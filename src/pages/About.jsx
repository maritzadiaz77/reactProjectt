      <h4>
        Hello, my name is Maritza Diaz! Let me tell you a little bit about me. I
        live in California in the central valley. My hobbies include lifting
        weights, hiking, and traveling. I love exploring our different states in
        America and going out of the country to explore other cultures. In the
        meantime when I am not occupied with my hobbies, I work on web
        development projects. You can find me on Github in the link below and my
        LinkedIn to know about my work history. You are welcome to check out my
        portfolio. If you wish to contact me, shoot me an email! I check my
        email everyday. Thanks for stopping by!
